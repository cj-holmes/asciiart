\usage{
asciiart(
  file,
  width = 80,
  text_scaling = 1,
  out_width = 8,
  out_name = NULL,
  text_col = "black",
  chars = c("@", "\%", "#", "*", "+", "=", "-", ":", ".", " "),
  print_text = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to image file or array returned from \code{jpeg::readJPEG(), png::read_PNG()}}

\item{width}{Width of output image in text characters. Use NA for original image width}

\item{text_scaling}{Text scaling factor for tweaking text size (default = 1)}

\item{out_width}{Output image width in inches}

\item{out_name}{File path including name for saved image}

\item{text_col}{Colour of text (default = "black")}

\item{chars}{Character vector set for ascii art (ordered from dark to light)}

\item{print_text}{Logical. Should the text making the picture by printed to the console?
This is hacky, every other row is removed from the image to roughly correct for vertical stretching. This
text output will not have the same aspect ratio as the original image}
}
\description{
Creates an ASCII-art/text-art image where pixel intensity is mapped to the density of character glyphs
}
\details{
A uniform grid image can be written to a device (png, pdf etc...) and an approximation of the same image
can be printed to the console (or the output of calling \code{asciiart()} could be written to a text
file with \code{readr::write_lines()}). The text written to the console by setting \code{print_text = TRUE} will not
maintain the exact same aspect ratio as the original image
}
