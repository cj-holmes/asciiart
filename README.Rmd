# asciiart

A very quick, very dirty, very simple and very nasty attempt at making ASCII art in R. Please forgive me.

The output is plotted on a uniform grid. The text printed to the console is an approxmation of the image, as rows are removed to counteract vertical stretching. This is not precise. The aspect ratio will not be the same as that of the original image.

```{r fig.width=8}
library(asciiart)
asciiart(asciiart::rstats)
```
