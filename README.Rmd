# asciiart

A very quick, very dirty, very simple and very nasty attempt at making ASCII art in R. Please forgive me.

This is ascii art when plotted on a uniform grid. When shown as text in a text editor it will look vertically stretched, as the aspect ratio of the character glyphs is not one! This needs to be changed and worked on.

```{r fig.height=6}
library(asciiart)
asciiart(asciiart::hadley)
```
